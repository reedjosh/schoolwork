\section{}

In order to allow for more freedom of personal style in the opinion piece, 
I will only provide some general guidelines and not a detailed outline and rubric. 
In 600 words or less you should briefly:

Present the environmental issue, choose and defend one of the viewpoints 
using strong supporting evidences (studies, examples, experiments, stories, etc.) and 
clearly, but respectfully, address the opposing viewpoint.

Present information in a format that is not only informative, but interesting and convincing.

Cite sources of any information, pictures or diagrams at the end of the piece.

\end{document}
