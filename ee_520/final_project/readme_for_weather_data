II. FORMAT OF THE DATA FILES 

Each data file contains data for all USHCN stations for one of the four 
meteorological variables Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, or precipitation. Temperature
values are given in tenths of degrees Fahrenheit (e.g., 725 indicates 72.5F)
and precipitation amounts are given in hundredths of inches (e.g., 468
indicates 4.68").

Each record (line) in the files contains one year of 12 monthly values plus an 
annual value.  

The values on each line include the following:

------------------------------
Variable   Columns   Type

STAID         1-11   Character
YEAR         13-16   Integer

QCFLAG13    132      Character
DSFLAG13    133      Character
------------------------------

These variables have the following definitions:

STAID      is the station identification code, containing country code ('US' for all
           USHCN stations, network code ('H' for Historical Climatology Network),
           columns 4-11='00'+6-digit Cooperative Observer ID number
           See "ushcn-stations.txt" for a complete list of stations
           and their metadata.
	   
YEAR       is the 4-digit year of the record.

VALUE1     is the value for January in the year of record; in tenths of
           degrees Fahrenheit for temperature (e.g., 725 indicates 72.5F) and hundredths
           of inches for precipitation (e.g., 468 indicates 4.68"). Missing data values
           are filled with "-9999".

DMFLAG1    is the data measurement flag for January in the year of record:

           Blank = no measurement information is applicable;
	   
           A - H = applying only to the relatively small number of values assigned using
           v1.0 of the USHCN database, indicates the number of days missing (1 to 8) in
           calculation of monthly mean temperature;

           a - i = applying to version 2.5 USHCN data values (the vast majority), the
           number of days missing (1 to 9) in calculation of monthly mean temperature;

           E = if QCFLAG and DSFLAG are both blank, 'E' indicates the data value is an
           estimate from surrounding values; no original value is available;

           I = applying only to the relatively small number of values assigned using v1.0
           of the USHCN database, indicates that the data value is interpolated using
           surrounding stations' values;

           . = applying only to the relatively small number of values assigned using v1.0
           of the USHCN database, indicates that the data value has been estimated;

QCFLAG1    is the quality flag for January in the year of record:

           Blank = no failure of quality control check or could not be
                   evaluated;

           d = Pairwise Homogenization Algorithm (PHA) has strong evidence that
               multiple inhomogeneities exist, but are too close to adjust;

           g = PHA cannot adjust station series previous to a given 
               inhomogeneity because there are too few neighbors
               to estimate the adjustment (uncommon);

DSFLAG1    is the data source flag for January in the year of record:

           Blank = value was computed from daily available in GHCN-Daily;

           Not Blank = daily data are not available so the monthly value was
                       obtained from the USHCN version 1 dataset. The possible
                       values are as follows:

               NCDC publication;

           8 = State Climatologists, various sources;

------------------------------

These variables have the following definitions:

COOP ID     is the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network station identification 
            code.  Note that the first two digits in the Coop Id correspond
            to the state. 

LATITUDE    is latitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

LONGITUDE   is the longitude of the station (in decimal degrees).

ELEVATION   is the elevation of the station (in meters, missing = -999.9).

STATE       is the U.S. postal code for the state.

NAME        is the name of the station location.

COMPONENT 1 is the Coop Id for the first station (in chronologic order) whose 
            records were joined with those of the HCN site to form a longer time
	    series.  "------" indicates "not applicable".
            
COMPONENT 2 is the Coop Id for the second station (if applicable) whose records 
            were joined with those of the HCN site to form a longer time series.
	    
COMPONENT 3 is the Coop Id for the third station (if applicable) whose records 
            were joined with those of the HCN site to form a longer time series.

UTC OFFSET  is the time difference between Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and 
            local standard time at the station (i.e., the number of hours that 
	    must be added to local standard time to match UTC).
