\section*{Events and their operations}
An event is a collection of outcomes of a random experiment \\
$S=\{$collection of all outcomes of the experiment$\}$ \\
$\phi = \{$empty set$\}$ \\
If $A\cap B=\phi$, \\ then $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive events\\
DeMorgan's $\bar{(A\cup B)} = (\bar{A}\cap \bar{B})$
