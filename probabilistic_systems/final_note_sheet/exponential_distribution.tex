\section*{Exponential Distribution}

\subsection*{General}
$X$ is the time to arrival or time to failure, where arrival rate is $\lambda$ \\
$X$ can also be viewed as departure time with departure rate $\mu$

\subsection*{Probability Density Function}
$f_x(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$, for $t>0$, and is $0$ elsewhere.

\subsection*{Cumulative Distribution Function}
$F_x(t) = 1-e{-\lambda t}$, for $t\geq0$, and is $0$ elsewhere.

\subsection*{Mean and Variance}
$m_x=\sigma_x=1/\lambda$
