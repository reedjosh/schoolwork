\begin{questions}


%------------------------------ Question 1
\question Suppose A is a random number chosen uniformly from the interval $(-8,8)$, what is the probability that the quadratic equation
    
\begin{center}
$x^2+Ax+4=0$
\end{center}
has no real root?

Here, $a=1$, $b=A$, and $c=4$ and the quadratic equation is $x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ .

%------------------------------ Question 2
\question Assume the resistance of R is a random variable, uniformly distributed on the interval $(800\Omega , 1200\Omega )$

\begin{parts}
\part Find the PDF of the resistance
\part Calculate $P(900\Omega , \leq R \leq 1000\Omega )$
\part Calculate $P(R=1100\Omega )$
\end{parts} 
 
%------------------------------ Question 3
\question In a resteaurant known for its unusual service, the time, in minutes, that a customer has to wait before he captures the attention of a waiter is specified by the following CDF:
\[ F_X(x) =
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{x^2}{2},           & 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
    1/2,                     & 1 \leq x \leq 8 \\
    \frac{1}{4}-\frac{3}{2}, & 8 \leq x \leq 10 \\
    1,                       & x \geq 10 \\
    \end{cases}
\]
 
\begin{parts}
\part Compute and sketch the PDF $f_x(x)$
\part Verify the area under the PDF is indeed unity
\part What is the probability that hte customer will have to wait at least 7 minutes?
\end{parts} 

%------------------------------ Question 4
\question In an automatic meter reading system, the electric measure and 
transmit the message to receivers. If the transmission fails, it tries again. 
If each message is repeated at most 5 times and a single transmission of a 
message is successful with probability $p=0.75$. If X is the random variable of 
the number of transmission, what is the probability mass function (PMF) of X? How about the CDF?
